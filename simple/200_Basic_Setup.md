\end{tipblock}

There are three main types of information:

* Main Parameters: These will populate the front cover and control many of the display options.
* Contact Params: Sets details about the person/organisation resposible for the report
* Report Specific Params: Parameter that will be consumed by the scripts or referenced in the documents.

### Using parameters

In a markdown file you can reference there using double curly braces.

In a script file you can use the following to get a parameter:

    ```
    from px_build_doc.util import fetch_var, display

    end_customer = fetch_var("end_customer")

    display(end_customer)
    ```

### Latex template Other parameters

The parameters are passed in the pandoc templating systems, which then passes them to latex. Latex uses a template which relies on a wide-variety of these parameters. Many of these might be set by default.

The default template can be found in `px_build_doc\data\my-panadoc.latex`
