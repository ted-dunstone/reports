Markdown: Basics
================


Getting the Gist of Markdown's Formatting Syntax
------------------------------------------------

This page offers a brief overview of what it's like to use Markdown.
The [syntax page] [s] provides complete, detailed documentation for
every feature, but Markdown should be very easy to pick up simply by
looking at a few examples of it in action. The examples on this page
are written in a before/after style, showing example syntax and the
HTML output produced by Markdown.


## Paragraphs, Headers, Blockquotes ##

A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated
by one or more blank lines. (A blank line is any line that looks like
a blank line -- a line containing nothing but spaces or tabs is
considered blank.) Normal paragraphs should not be indented with
spaces or tabs.

Markdown offers two styles of headers: *Setext* and *atx*.
Setext-style headers for `<h1>` and `<h2>` are created by
"underlining" with equal signs (`=`) and hyphens (`-`), respectively.
To create an atx-style header, you put 1-6 hash marks (`#`) at the
beginning of the line -- the number of hashes equals the resulting
HTML header level.

Blockquotes are indicated using email-style '`>`' angle brackets.

Markdown:

    A First Level Header
    ====================
    
    A Second Level Header
    ---------------------

    Now is the time for all good men to come to
    the aid of their country. This is just a
    regular paragraph.

    The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy
    dog's back.
    
    ### Header 3

    > This is a blockquote.
    > 
    > This is the second paragraph in the blockquote.
    >
    > ## This is an H2 in a blockquote




### Phrase Emphasis ###

Markdown uses asterisks and underscores to indicate spans of emphasis.

Markdown:

    Some of these words *are emphasized*.
    Some of these words _are emphasized also_.
    
    Use two asterisks for **strong emphasis**.
    Or, if you prefer, __use two underscores instead__.   


## Lists ##

Unordered (bulleted) lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens (`*`,
`+`, and `-`) as list markers. These three markers are
interchangable; this:

    *   Candy.
    *   Gum.
    *   Booze.

this:

    +   Candy.
    +   Gum.
    +   Booze.

and this:

    -   Candy.
    -   Gum.
    -   Booze.


Ordered (numbered) lists use regular numbers, followed by periods, as
list markers:

    1.  Red
    2.  Green
    3.  Blue


If you put blank lines between items, you'll get `<p>` tags for the
list item text. You can create multi-paragraph list items by indenting
the paragraphs by 4 spaces or 1 tab:

    *   A list item.
    
        With multiple paragraphs.

    *   Another item in the list.



### Links ###

Markdown supports two styles for creating links: *inline* and
*reference*. With both styles, you use square brackets to delimit the
text you want to turn into a link.

Inline-style links use parentheses immediately after the link text.
For example:

    This is an [example link](http://example.com/).

Optionally, you may include a title attribute in the parentheses:

    This is an [example link](http://example.com/ "With a Title").

Reference-style links allow you to refer to your links by names, which
you define elsewhere in your document:

    I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][1] than from
    [Yahoo][2] or [MSN][3].

    [1]: http://google.com/        "Google"
    [2]: http://search.yahoo.com/  "Yahoo Search"
    [3]: http://search.msn.com/    "MSN Search"

The title attribute is optional. Link names may contain letters,
numbers and spaces, but are *not* case sensitive:

    I start my morning with a cup of coffee and
    [The New York Times][NY Times].

    [ny times]: http://www.nytimes.com/

### Images ###

Image syntax is very much like link syntax.

Inline (titles are optional):

    ![alt text](/path/to/img.jpg "Title")

Reference-style:

    ![alt text][id]

    [id]: /path/to/img.jpg "Title"


### Code ###

In a regular paragraph, you can create code span by wrapping text in
backtick quotes. Any ampersands (`&`) and angle brackets (`<` or
`>`) will automatically be translated into HTML entities. This makes
it easy to use Markdown to write about HTML example code:

    I strongly recommend against using any `<blink>` tags.

    I wish SmartyPants used named entities like `&mdash;`
    instead of decimal-encoded entites like `&#8212;`.


To specify an entire block of pre-formatted code, indent every line of
the block by 4 spaces or 1 tab. Just like with code spans, `&`, `<`,
and `>` characters will be escaped automatically.

Markdown:

    If you want your page to validate under XHTML 1.0 Strict,
    you've got to put paragraph tags in your blockquotes:

        <blockquote>
            <p>For example.</p>
        </blockquote>

## Tables ##

If you wish, you can add a leading and tailing pipe to each line of the table. Use the form that you like. As an illustration, this will give the same result as above:

    | First Header  | Second Header |
    | ------------- | ------------- |
    | Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
    | Content Cell  | Content Cell  |

Note: A table need at least one pipe on each line for Markdown Extra to parse it correctly. This means that the only way to create a one-column table is to add a leading or a tailing pipe, or both of them, to each line.

You can specify alignment for each column by adding colons to separator lines. A colon at the left of the separator line will make the column left-aligned; a colon on the right of the line will make the column right-aligned; colons at both side means the column is center-aligned.

    | Item      | Value |
    | --------- | -----:|
    | Computer  | $1600 |
    | Phone     |   $12 |
    | Pipe      |    $1 |

The align HTML attribute is applied to each cell of the concerned column.

You can apply span-level formatting to the content of each cell using regular Markdown syntax:

    See table \ref{my_table}.

    | Function name | Description                    |
    | ------------- | ------------------------------ |
    | `help()`      | Display the help window.       |
    | `destroy()`   | **Destroy your computer!**     |

    Table: Example Table \label{my_table}

See table \ref{my_table}.


| Function name | Description                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `help()`      | Display the help window.       |
| `destroy()`   | **Destroy your computer!**     |

Table: Example Table \label{my_table}

## Definition Lists

Markdown Extra implements definition lists. Definition lists are made of terms and definitions of these terms, much like in a dictionary.

A simple definition list in Markdown Extra is made of a single-line term followed by a colon and the definition for that term.

    Apple
    :   Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in 
        the family Rosaceae.

    Orange
    :   The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.

Terms must be separated from the previous definition by a blank line. Definitions can span on multiple lines, in which case they should be indented. But you donâ€™t really have to: if you want to be lazy, you could forget to indent a definition that span on multiple lines and it will still work:

Apple
:   Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in 
the family Rosaceae.

Orange
:   The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.


## Footnotes

Footnotes work mostly like reference-style links. A footnote is made of two things: a marker in the text that will become a superscript number; a footnote definition that will be placed in a list of footnotes at the end of the document. A footnote looks like this:

    That's some text with a footnote.[^1]

    [^1]: And that's the footnote.

Footnote definitions can be found anywhere in the document, but footnotes will always be listed in the order they are linked to in the text. Note that you cannot make two links to the same footnotes: if you try, the second footnote reference will be left as plain text.

Each footnote must have a distinct name. That name will be used to link footnote references to footnote definitions, but has no effect on the numbering of the footnotes. Names can contain any character valid within an id attribute in HTML.

Footnotes can contain block-level elements, which means that you can put multiple paragraphs, lists, blockquotes and so on in a footnote. It works the same as for list items: just indent the following paragraphs by four spaces in the footnote definition:

That's some text with a footnote.[^1]

[^1]: And that's the footnote.

    That's the second paragraph.

If you want things to align better, you can leave the first line of the footnote empty and put your first paragraph just below:

[^1]:
    And that's the footnote.

    That's the second paragraph.


## Checklists

A checklist can be specified using latex as below:

    \begin{itemize}\item[$\square$]
    First Item\item[\rlap{\raisebox{0.3ex}{\hspace{0.4ex}\scriptsize \ding{56}}}$\square$] 
    Second Item\item[\rlap{\raisebox{0.3ex}{\hspace{0.4ex}\tiny \ding{52}}}$\square$] 
    Third Item\item[$\square$]
    Last Item\end{itemize}

This produces:

\begin{itemize}\item[$\square$]
First Item\item[\rlap{\raisebox{0.3ex}{\hspace{0.4ex}\scriptsize \ding{56}}}$\square$] 
Second Item\item[\rlap{\raisebox{0.3ex}{\hspace{0.4ex}\tiny \ding{52}}}$\square$] 
Third Item\item[$\square$]
Last Item\end{itemize}
