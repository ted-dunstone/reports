# Introduction

This report is produced using Performix. It is designed as a very bare bones example of a report.

You can use this as a base for any other report you are working on. Some important considerations include:

* Documents are preceeded by three digits `ddd` these specify the ordering for the sections in a document.

See table \ref{features_table}.

| Function name | Description                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `help()`      | Display the help window.       |
| `destroy()`   | **Destroy your computer!**     |
