# PxReport Samples

This is the biometix performix reports directory. It contains examples of reports that can be used with performix. Additional reports can be simply built by using one of these directories as a base.

**TODO**: More examples will be added soon.

**Please help to keep these instructions up to date**

## Integration

To integrate with the performix docker solution create a subdirectory `report` under the main directory. Then clone the repo into that directory.

* px-build-doc
 * report
   * samples
   * covid19
   ...

## Running a report

Assuming the docker environment is setup you can run:

`./build_doc.sh report/samples/simple`

This will build a pdf and a ppt.

`output.pdf`
`presentation.pdf`

## Documentation on design and use

This is provided by running the sample doc as above.

Ulimately this should be linked.
