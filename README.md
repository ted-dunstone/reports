# PxReport Samples

This is the biometix performix reports directory. It contains examples of reports that can be used with performix. Additional reports can be simply built by cloning one of these repositories.

## Integration

To integrate with the performix docker solution create a subdirectory `report` under the main directory. Then clone the repo into that directory.
